# SURFSolutions

## Task 1:
By opening both files on ApE, I'm able to see the DNA sequences and see how well they align. There are 5328 matches in the DNA fragment. I also ran NCBI BLAST queries on both the control and test sequences, and found that the fragments given to me are artificial, and consists of various transformation/cloning vectors. Running xblast gives that the fragment makes a lactose repressor protein derived from E. coli. I don't know how to design primers, but after designing primers I would do the following:<br />
  
 1. Run PCR and gel electrophoresis to confirm the success of PCR <br />
 2. Plate E. coli, electrotransform and inoculate the plate, adn miniprep the e. coli plate.<br />
 3. Design primers to sequence the plasmid (I have no idea how to do this)<br />
 4. Take the sequencing data to find what I'm testing<br />


## Task 2:

My source code is found in sln_2.ipynb, backed up by sln_2.html in the repository. The frequency graphs that I plot are also located in the sln_2.html file. If I have enough time, I will convert these into histograms. Based on this data and my naive frequency plots, I think it is safe to conclude that jellyfish do sleep, as their interpulse times increase significantly during the nighttime. However, further graphs are needed. Given enough time, I would generate graphs comparing the average interpulse times during the day and night, an ecdf plot, and a butterworth frequency filter.
