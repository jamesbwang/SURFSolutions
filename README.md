Task 1: To be updated here


Task 2: Do Jellyfish sleep?

My source code is found in sln_2.ipynb, backed up by sln_2.html in the repository. The frequency graphs that I plot are also located in the sln_2.html file. If I have enough time, I will convert these into histograms. Based on this data and my naive frequency plots, I think it is safe to conclude that jellyfish do sleep, as their interpulse timees decrease significantly during the nighttime. However, further graphs are needed. Given enough time, I would generate graphs comparing the average interpulse times during the day and night, an ecdf plot, and a butterworth frequency filter.
